    Turns out going right...was the right decision! *high fives self*
    <br>
    You find a house in the middle of nowhere, and when you go inside you find all the money you could ever need, conveniently stacked in packages of 1,000 dollar bills. 
    <br>

    <br>
    Suddenly amidst your glee from aquiring such wealth, you hear a creaking noise coming from below you. Do you take all the money you can carry and run, or do you go to the basement and investigate?
